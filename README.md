# gen_booklist_extension

`gen_booklist_extension` is a **Chrome extension** version of [gen_booklist](https://github.com/plasmabal/gen_booklist).
It detects supported book sites automatically and lets you collect book information (title, author, etc.) directly from your online bookshelf pages.

When you open a supported page, the extension icon shows a red dot 🔴 indicating that the site is supported.
Click the icon to collect the book list — the book info will be copied to your clipboard, ready to be pasted into Excel or Google Sheets.

This project is inspired by [this presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WMrwjj6R927XEYJKVX4eqGnJKkJ9s-8wTrl8ckd9ws8/edit?fbclid=IwAR1BDVfNE1L2uIowHP97S768LXodbvTzokMpzdA9oP1KBEhio6kBDHnMrJI#slide=id.gc2c595ec36_0_7) by **高振綱**, originally shared in the Facebook group *Readmoo讀墨×mooInk 線上討論區*.
The original was a Tampermonkey script — this version is a fully standalone Chrome extension.

## 🧩 Technical Overview

`gen_booklist_extension` is built as a modern Chrome extension with the following structure:

| File | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| `manifest.json` | Declares permissions, scripts, and icons |
| `background.js` | Detects supported sites, updates the badge icon |
| `content.js` | Extracts book data from the active page |
| `popup.html` / `popup.js` | User interface for triggering actions |
| `utils.js` | Shared helper functions |

When a supported domain is detected, `background.js` signals the popup to enable the **Collect** button and displays a red indicator on the extension icon.

---

## 🧪 Development Notes

- To reload during development, go to `chrome://extensions/` and click **Reload (⟳)**.
- Use `console.log()` for debugging both `background.js` and `content.js`.
- **Background logs:** `chrome://extensions/` → “Inspect views: background page”
- **Content logs:** Chrome DevTools (F12) → Console
- To add support for a new site, update the domain detection list in `background.js` and parsing logic in `content.js` or `utils.js`.
